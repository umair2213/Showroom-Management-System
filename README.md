**Showroom Management System in Java**

Welcome to the Showroom Management System, a Java-based application that brings efficiency and organization to your car showroom operations. This project exemplifies key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring a robust and scalable solution.

### Key Features:

1. **Encapsulation:**
   - Private properties in the `PurchaseForm` and `Car` classes.
   - Public methods controlling access to encapsulated data.

2. **Inheritance:**
   - The `UsedCar` class extends the `Car` class, promoting code reusability and hierarchy.

3. **Polymorphism:**
   - Explore method overriding in the `UsedCar` class, specifically in the `sellCar` method.

4. **Constructor:**
   - Constructors are utilized to initialize object properties during instantiation, ensuring proper setup.

5. **Method Overriding:**
   - Witness method overriding in the `UsedCar` class, enhancing flexibility and adaptability.

6. **Method Overloading:**
   - Multiple versions of the `generateNumberPlate` method accommodate various scenarios.

7. **Object Instantiation:**
   - Instances of classes (`PurchaseForm`, `Car`, `UsedCar`) are created, representing real-world entities.

8. **Composition:**
   - Lists of objects from other classes (`purchaseHistory` and `sellHistory`) in the `Main` class for a holistic approach.

9. **Static Method:**
   - The `generateNumberPlate` method is designed as static for utility and ease of use.

10. **Access Modifiers:**
    - Public, private, and protected access modifiers are thoughtfully applied, ensuring appropriate data access.

11. **Instance Variables:**
    - Classes have well-defined instance variables representing distinct object states.

12. **Conditional Statements:**
    - Experience intelligent decision-making with conditional statements (e.g., price adjustment in `sellCar` method).

13. **Looping:**
    - Do-while and for loops are employed for streamlined execution and user interaction.

14. **Input/Output:**
    - Utilizing `Scanner` for user input and `System.out.println` for output, the system ensures a user-friendly experience.

### How to Use:

1. **Buy Cars:**
   - Input details like car name, model, manufacturing year, color, fuel type, and transmission type.
   - The system generates a purchase form, followed by a buyer's information form.
   - Finalize the purchase, and witness the automatic generation of a unique number plate.

2. **Sell Cars:**
   - Provide necessary details to create a sell form.
   - Fill in seller's information to complete the selling process.
   - Track the selling history for comprehensive record-keeping.

3. **Check History:**
   - Explore the purchase and sell history seamlessly, ensuring transparency and accountability.
